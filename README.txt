This repository contains three sorting algorithms inside the sorting.py file:
    - Insertion sort
    - Merge sort
    - Quick sort

The main function includes flexibility for different delimeters, data types,
    and comparisson functions. Also, feel free to pass all arguments at once 
    if you want to avoid the prompts

Last but not least, feel free to look at the testing.py file for some simple
    black-box testing scripts. Enjoy!
